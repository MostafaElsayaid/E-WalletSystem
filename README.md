E-Wallet System Project – OOP-Based Application

This project is a fully functional E-Wallet System designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The system provides users with all essential operations commonly found in modern digital wallet platforms.

Key Features:
Create an account – Allows new users to register and open a wallet account.

Log in – Secure authentication for existing users to access their accounts.

View account details and available balance – Users can check their personal information and current wallet balance.

Deposit – Add funds to the wallet balance.

Withdraw – Securely withdraw money from the wallet.

View all previous transactions – Display a complete history of all transactions (deposits, withdrawals, etc.).

Edit account information – Users can update their personal details securely.

The system simulates real-world wallet functionality and demonstrates how OOP concepts can be applied in practical software development. It can serve as a solid base for more advanced financial systems and helps in understanding the architecture of secure and scalable applications.
